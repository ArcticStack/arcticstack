ArcticStack
===========

**ArcticStack** is a software stack which aims to provide Ansible Collections,
playbooks and tools to deploy and manage HPC and AI clusters based on RHEL-like
operating systems.

This project is a fork of `BlueBanquise <https://bluebanquise.com>` 1.4.0.
BlueBanquise supports a wider range of operating systems and has a simpler
implementation of Ansible roles which target teaching purposes. The name Arctic
is a wink to BlueBanquise.
